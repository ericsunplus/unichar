## Introduction
The `unichar` plugin is created for some special unicode insert. Vim support
diagraphs to input frequently used unicode like `℃`, `√`, etc. However, there
are other unicode charactors which don't have pre-defined diagraphs. The
plugin is aimed at providing a convinient way to input these charactors

## Usage
### Input Circled Number ❶ ~ ⓴
Use `<Leader>ucn`, enter the number between [1, 20] in the vim prompt, the
corresponding circled number will be put on the cursor
